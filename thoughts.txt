# Thoughts on how to model something in my project

1. I need two fields:
    a. One visible field -> Visible for me and the other players
    b. Field for all cards (hidden and visible)

Solution ideas:
	field_hidden = {player: (value: int, position: [tuple e.g. (1,2)], hidden or visible: [boolean])}
	field_visible = numpy array with the value if visible or "*" if hidden

2. How do I check if one line vertically or horizontally is full of with the same numbers, in order to delete the whole line (or set all values to 0)?

Modelling:

	(0,0)	(0,1)	(0,2)	(0,3)
	(1,0)	(1,1)	(1,2)	(1,3)
	(2,0)	(2,1)	(2,2)	(2,3)	

	for every line:
		if first coord the same for row dimension:
			delete row (set values to 0 [cannot be changed])
		if second coord the same for column dimension:
			delete col (set values to 0 [cannot be changed])
	 
	[(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1),...]
	
	counter_row = 0
	conunter_col = 0
	
	# get x and y values
	x_values = []
	y_values = []
	for tup in list:
		x_values.append(tup[0])
		y_values.append(tup[1])

	for i in range(col_dim):
		xval_counter = x_values.count(i)
		if xval_counter == col_dim:
			# delete row => set all values in row to 0

	for i in range(row_dim):
		yval_counter = y_values.count(i)
		if yval_counter == row_dim:
			# delete column => set all values in column to 0
