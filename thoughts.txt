# Thoughts on how to model something in my project

1. I need two fields:
    a. One visible field -> Visible for me and the other players
    b. Field for all cards (hidden and visible)

Solution ideas:
	field_hidden = {player: (value: int, position: [tuple e.g. (1,2)], hidden or visible: [boolean])}
	field_visible = numpy array with the value if visible or "*" if hidden
