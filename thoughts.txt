# Thoughts on how to model something in my project

1. I need two fields:
    a. One visible field -> Visible for me and the other players
    b. Field for all cards (hidden and visible)

Solution ideas:
	field_hidden = {player: (value: int, position: [tuple e.g. (1,2)], hidden or visible: [boolean])}
	field_visible = numpy array with the value if visible or "*" if hidden

2. How do I check if one line vertically or horizontally is full of with the same numbers, in order to delete the whole line (or set all values to 0)?

Modelling:

	(0,0)	(0,1)	(0,2)	(0,3)
	(1,0)	(1,1)	(1,2)	(1,3)
	(2,0)	(2,1)	(2,2)	(2,3)	

	for every line:
		if first coord the same for row dimension:
			delete row (set values to 0 [cannot be changed])
		if second coord the same for column dimension:
			delete col (set values to 0 [cannot be changed])
	 
	[(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1),...]
	
	counter_row = 0
	conunter_col = 0
	
	# get x and y values
	x_values = []
	y_values = []
	for tup in list:
		x_values.append(tup[0])
		y_values.append(tup[1])

	for i in range(col_dim):
		xval_counter = x_values.count(i)
		if xval_counter == col_dim:
			# delete row => set all values in row to 0

	for i in range(row_dim):
		yval_counter = y_values.count(i)
		if yval_counter == row_dim:
			# delete column => set all values in column to 0

	self.hidden_field = [{"Sven": ['value', (0,0), True], ...}]
	
3. Another Problem: Now I can set all values in the row or column to 0 if all the values in the row or column are the same. But how to handle other rows and columns that contains also the same values after I set a row/column to 0? In the real game the dimension of the field is changing because you put the cards away.
	
	How can I model this here?
	
	before: (3x4)
	
	o	o	o	o
	x	x	x	x
	x	x	x	x

	--> after: (2x3)
	
	Idea: Set a special character to the values in the row/column that is deleted e.g. "-"
	Solved with that, but that results in a similar problem

3.1. When one row/column is deleted the values have different neighbours
	
	Like: 
	4	-	*	*	
	♦	-	*	*	
	♦	-	*	*
	
	What if (0,2) and (0,3) are also a '4'. Then this line will also be deleted to "-"
	
	Solved with counting the elements in row/column. Dictionary thats stores element (key) and number of occurence in row/column (values). If number is >= 3 than this row/column will be set to "-". 
	
	Another problem: First I check rows then I check cloumns. Problem in the following case:
	
	4	-[4]	2	-[4]
	*	-[4]	*	-[4]
	4	-[4]	4	-[4]

	in [] is the number before the column will set to "-". Now: last row will also be set to "-" because the column will be checked after row. But the rule is: Set row/column to "-" if there are more than 3 values the same in the same row/column.


	How can I solve that?
	=> Had to add check_full_line() to method "_set_values()"
	In __str__ when I print the field I will call check_full_line()

4. Player order is [a, b, c]. What if b ended the game? Everyone else has exactly one turn. How to handle that?

5. If star is pulled from the deck and changed with card on field player can chosse a value for this card but only for this round. If this value completes a row/column with all the same numbers the row/column will be deleted (set to "-") till the end.

	And: If star is flipped on the field, the player can also choose a value for this card for this round. If this value completes a row/column with all the same numbers the row/column will be deleted (set to "-") till the end.

    I will implement this later

6. Which actions do I have?

    a. Pull a card from the deck
        a1. Change a card on the field with a card from the deck
        a2. Put card on discard stack and turn around one card on your field
    b. Pull a card from the discard stack
        a1. Change a card on the field with a card from the deck
        a2. Put card on discard stack and turn around one card on your field

    => 4 different actions overall

    How to model these actions?

    action1 = ("pull deck", ("change", (0,0)))
    action2 = ("pull deck", ("flip", (0,0)))
    action3 = ("pull discard", ("change", (0,0)))
    action4 = ("pull discard", ("flip", (0,0)))

7. Problem with RandomAgent in method "simulate_agent_games".
    => For every run the game uses the same agent. After run 1 game has finished and in the second run the game will use
    that from the run before. I need to initiate a new agent for every run. How to do that?

8. What are some strategies for the SimpleReflexAgent?

    a. At beginning. Just flip cards beside each other in order to maximize the chance to get full row/column.
    b. If a card on discard stack is lower than one card on the field, pull card from discard stack and change it with the card on the field.
    Else pull card from deck and check if the card one hand is lower than the card on the field. If yes, change it with the card on the field.
    Else put card on discard stack and turn around one card on the field next to a card that is already flipped.
    If card is same with a card on field that is flipped, put card next to it in order to get a row/column that will be then deleted if row/column is full.
